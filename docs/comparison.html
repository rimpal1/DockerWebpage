    <h4>Virtualization vs Containerization</h4>
    <hr>

    <p>After taking a look at each of these technologies, the question is, which one should be used? The answer is that
        it depends on several different points. Essentially, each business and application will have different needs,
        requirements, and purpose. The choice of virtualization versus containerization depends on the business
        development and operational model, and the way applications are written and produced. Both are software
        technologies that create self-contained virtual packages, but to choose the one that will best suit the user’s
        needs, we will look at the following points.

    </p>

         style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
    <ul>
        <li><p>Speed: When it comes to speed, containers were meant to significantly reduce the time needed to deploy
            and run an
            application. The container starts immediately, since the operating system is already up and running, so the
            application will start up without any noticeable delay. This is an excellent solution for a development
            environment, mainly, as it saves time in the application testing cycle. On the other hand, virtual machines
            need
            to start the entire operating system, which includes the full boot process. This will also include the
            startup
            of the services, and it will take much longer than it would for a container.</p></li>

        <li><p>Resources: Since virtual servers run separate operating systems, and every system call has to go through
            the virtualization layer, a certain amount of overhead is created, causing more resources to be used. This
            is particularly true for memory usage, as virtual machines consume memory even when they aren’t running any
            user processes. However, CPU virtualization is relatively cheap, so the CPU overhead of a virtual machine
            can be much smaller. When it comes to containers, they can start up pretty quickly, so their memory
            consumption doesn't increase. There is also much less overhead as they are using the same operating system
            without a hypervisor to go through.</p></li>

        <li><p>Operating system requirements: A virtual machine is best used in the case when a business needs to run
            multiple applications that require the full functionality of a dedicated operating system. However, if most
            of the applications have the same operating system requirements, the containers would be a much more
            practical solution.</p></li>

    </ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>To summarize, we can see that each technology serves a different purpose and that choosing one depends heavily on
        the user and application needs and server capacity. Since both virtualization and containerization come with
        significant advantages and drawbacks, choosing one over the other needs to be done carefully with these points
        in mind.</p>
