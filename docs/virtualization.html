    <p>With the constant technological development we are witnessing in the world of hosting, it is necessary to
        familiarize ourselves with the terminology and meaning of the systems we are using. An important distinction
        that we need to make is between virtual machines and containers, as they are both widely used in the hosting
        industry, and yet they are often confused.</p>
    <p>The discussion that frequently arises is which technology is better, virtualization, or containerization. The
        answer is not a simple one, as it depends heavily on the userâ€™s needs and business requirements. To try and
        answer this question, we will first provide a rundown on both of these technologies, how they are used, in which
        situations they are most beneficial, and what the advantages and disadvantages are.</p>

    <h4>What is Virtualization?</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>To better understand the functionalities of virtual machines, we need to understand why they were created in the
        first place. As bare-metal servers improved in processing power and capacity, applications and services that
        were running on those servers failed to effectively utilize all of the available resources and as such, those
        resources were essentially wasted. Virtualization was created to take better advantage of all of the available
        reserves on a single server. This allowed for multiple virtual machines to better apply the same amount of
        resources.</p>
    <p>Virtualization provides for the existence of multiple, smaller virtual servers, within the framework of a larger
        server's physical environment. The virtualization software which runs on the parent basically allocates
        resources to each virtual server along with its own operating system, drivers, binaries, libraries, and
        applications. These virtual servers are isolated from each other and have no knowledge they are running within a
        virtualized platform nor aware that they are sharing resources with the other virtual machines.</p>

         style="width:60%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
    <p>Since each virtual machine is essentially a virtual copy of the hardware of the host server and uses its own
        operating system, it can be resource-heavy and slow, while consuming a great deal of memory and processing
        power. Each virtual machine can also be significant in size, which limits its portability and thus cannot easily
        be shared.</p>
